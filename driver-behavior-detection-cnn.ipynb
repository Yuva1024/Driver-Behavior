These are just some of the most popular CNN structures used in image analysis tasks. Each structure in CNN has its own unique features and advantages and because of that, if we want to use CNN for a case, we have to use more than one structure for comparing which of these structures are better fitting to our images.\n","    \n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"d43296e9","metadata":{"papermill":{"duration":0.020936,"end_time":"2023-10-18T18:26:33.025103","exception":false,"start_time":"2023-10-18T18:26:33.004167","status":"completed"},"tags":[],"id":"d43296e9"},"source":["<a id=\"2\"></a>\n","# <p style=\"padding:10px;background-color:#fda628 ;margin:0;color:#ffffff;font-family:newtimeroman;font-size:100%;text-align:center;border-radius: 15px 50px;overflow:hidden;font-weight:500\">About this project </p>"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"205015d5","metadata":{"papermill":{"duration":0.022434,"end_time":"2023-10-18T18:26:33.069897","exception":false,"start_time":"2023-10-18T18:26:33.047463","status":"completed"},"tags":[],"id":"205015d5"},"source":["<div style = 'border : 3px solid non; background-color:#f2f2f2 ; ;padding:10px'>\n","\n","\n","* **1. Why CNN?**\n","\n","  - CNN (Convolutional Neural Network) is a deep learning-based method that is used for driver behavior detection. CNN is a type of neural network that is designed to recognize patterns in images and videos. CNNs are particularly useful for image classification tasks because they can automatically learn to detect features such as edges, corners, and shapes in images. In driver behavior detection, CNNs are used to analyze video footage of drivers and identify patterns of behavior that may indicate unsafe driving practices.\n","   \n","   \n","* **2. Importance of this topic**\n","    \n","  - Data behavior detection is important because it helps to identify potential cybersecurity threats by tracking user behavior and data access activities. By analyzing both user behavior and data access activities, a behavior analytics tool can create a contextual behavior baseline to help discern behaviors that are normal from those that are not and accurately identify critical data threats.\n","  \n","    \n","  \n","* **Note**\n","    - I just want to show you the performance of CNN on this topic and It's all about the structure of AlexNet, VGGNet and ResNet. In next projects I will consider the other parts of this project that I mentioned on the recommendation part (Part 10)."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"02bba34c","metadata":{"papermill":{"duration":0.022462,"end_time":"2023-10-18T18:26:33.156470","exception":false,"start_time":"2023-10-18T18:26:33.134008","status":"completed"},"tags":[],"id":"02bba34c"},"source":["<a id=\"3\"></a>\n","# <p style=\"padding:10px;background-color:#fda628 ;margin:0;color:#ffffff;font-family:newtimeroman;font-size:100%;text-align:center;border-radius: 15px 50px;overflow:hidden;font-weight:500\">Import Libraries </p>"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"id":"e77b1bd6","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.execute_input":"2023-10-18T18:26:33.202491Z","iopub.status.busy":"2023-10-18T18:26:33.202201Z","iopub.status.idle":"2023-10-18T18:26:49.299385Z","shell.execute_reply":"2023-10-18T18:26:49.298654Z"},"papermill":{"duration":16.122788,"end_time":"2023-10-18T18:26:49.301773","exception":false,"start_time":"2023-10-18T18:26:33.178985","status":"completed"},"tags":[],"id":"e77b1bd6"},"outputs":[],"source":["import warnings\n","warnings.filterwarnings(\"ignore\")\n","from numpy import asarray\n","import numpy as np\n","import pandas as pd\n","from PIL import Image\n","import cv2\n","import glob\n","import os\n","import random\n","import subprocess\n","import matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n","from skimage.io import imread\n","from matplotlib.patches import Rectangle\n","import tensorflow as tf\n","from tensorflow import keras\n","from tensorflow.keras import layers, models, Input, Model\n","from tensorflow.keras.preprocessing.image import ImageDataGenerator\n","from tensorflow.keras.optimizers import Adam\n","from tensorflow.keras.losses import BinaryCrossentropy"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"2db4fb45","metadata":{"papermill":{"duration":0.021723,"end_time":"2023-10-18T18:26:49.348045","exception":false,"start_time":"2023-10-18T18:26:49.326322","status":"completed"},"tags":[],"id":"2db4fb45"},"source":["<a id=\"4\"></a>\n","# <p style=\"padding:10px;background-color:#fda628 ;margin:0;color:#ffffff;font-family:newtimeroman;font-size:100%;text-align:center;border-radius: 15px 50px;overflow:hidden;font-weight:500\">Import Dataset </p>"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"cb969795","metadata":{"papermill":{"duration":0.021763,"end_time":"2023-10-18T18:26:49.391748","exception":false,"start_time":"2023-10-18T18:26:49.369985","status":"completed"},"tags":[],"id":"cb969795"},"source":["<div style = 'border : 3px solid non; background-color:#f2f2f2 ; ;padding:10px'>\n","\n","\n","* **Calling the images from directory**\n","\n","  - There is 5 differente folder for each class.

It is used primarily for image recognition and classification tasks. AlexNet was the winner of the ImageNet Large Scale Visual Recognition Challenge in 2012, which marked a breakthrough in deep learning. The network contains eight layers; the first five are convolutional layers, some of them followed by max-pooling layers, and the last three are fully connected layers. The network is split into two copies, each run on one GPU. AlexNet uses ReLU activation functions and dropout regularization to prevent overfitting. The architecture of AlexNet has inspired many other CNN architectures that have been developed since its introduction.\n","   \n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"19853cf3","metadata":{"papermill":{"duration":0.141462,"end_time":"2023-10-18T18:27:29.032882","exception":false,"start_time":"2023-10-18T18:27:28.891420","status":"completed"},"tags":[],"id":"19853cf3"},"source":["<div style = 'border : 3px solid non; background-color:#f2f2f2 ; ;padding:10px'>\n","\n","\n","* **2.

What is ResNet?**\n","\n","  - ResNet (Residual Network) is a deep learning-based model that uses residual connections to improve training performance and accuracy. The architecture of ResNet is designed to solve the problem of vanishing gradients that occurs when training deep neural networks. ResNet introduces the concept of residual blocks, which use skip connections to connect activations of a layer to further layers by skipping some layers in between. This forms a residual block, and ResNets are made by stacking these residual blocks together. The approach behind this network is instead of layers learning the underlying mapping, we allow the network to fit the residual mapping. So, instead of say H (x), initial mapping, let the network fit, F (x) := H (x) - x which gives H (x) := F (x) + x. The skip connection connects activations of a layer to further layers by skipping some layers in between. This results in training a very deep neural network without the problems caused by vanishing/exploding gradient. ResNet is widely used in image classification tasks and has inspired many other CNN architectures that have been developed since its introduction.\n","   \n","\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"b7991dea","metadata":{"papermill":{"duration":0.395724,"end_time":"2023-10-18T19:30:09.991027","exception":false,"start_time":"2023-10-18T19:30:09.595303","status":"completed"},"tags":[],"id":"b7991dea"},"source":["<div style = 'border : 3px solid non; background-color:#f2f2f2 ; ;padding:10px'>\n","\n","\n","* **2.

These libraries will help you to capture video from a camera, convert text to speech, and run multiple tasks simultaneously.\n","Define a function that will play a voice message when motion is detected. You can use pyttsx3 to create an engine object and set its properties, such as voice, rate, and volume. Then you can use the say method to speak a message and the runAndWait method to wait until the message is finished.\n","Define another function that will detect motion using OpenCV. You can use cv2.VideoCapture to access the camera and cv2.cvtColor to convert the frames to grayscale. Then you can use cv2.absdiff to calculate the difference between two consecutive frames and cv2.threshold to binarize the image. If the number of white pixels in the image is greater than a certain threshold, it means that motion is detected.\n","Use threading to run both functions in parallel. You can create two thread objects and pass the functions as arguments. Then you can use the start method to start the threads and the join method to wait until they finish.\n","Test your code and adjust the parameters as needed. You can change the threshold value, the voice message, or the camera index according to your preference.\n","   \n","\n"]},{"cell_type":"code","source":[],"metadata":{"id":"oHGc6C4jPr3M"},"id":"oHGc6C4jPr3M","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["import pandas as pd\n","from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split\n","from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier\n","from sklearn.metrics import classification_report\n","\n","# Load dataset\n","data = pd.read_csv(\"driver_behavior.csv\")\n","\n","# Feature selection\n","X = data.drop(\"behavior_label\", axis=1)\n","y = data[\"behavior_label\"]\n","\n","# Split dataset\n","X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)\n","\n","# Train model\n","model = RandomForestClassifier(n_estimators=100, random_state=42)\n","model.fit(X_train, y_train)\n","\n","# Evaluate model\n","y_pred = model.predict(X_test)\n","print(classification_report(y_test, y_pred))\n"],"metadata":{"id":"LK8cN5YyPrzM"},"id":"LK8cN5YyPrzM","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"080564d8","metadata":{"papermill":{"duration":0.616271,"end_time":"2023-10-18T19:52:52.671334","exception":false,"start_time":"2023-10-18T19:52:52.055063","status":"completed"},"tags":[],"id":"080564d8"},"source":["# <p style=\"padding:10px;background-color:#fab72f ;margin:0;color:#ffffff;font-family:newtimeroman;font-size:100%;text-align:center;border-radius: 15px 50px;overflow:hidden;font-weight:500\">Warm Wishes</p>"]}],"metadata":{"kernelspec":{"display_name":"Python 3","language":"python","name":"python3"},"language_info":{"codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3},"file_extension":".py","mimetype":"text/x-python","name":"python","nbconvert_exporter":"python","pygments_lexer":"ipython3","version":"3.10.12"},"papermill":{"default_parameters":{},"duration":5187.750527,"end_time":"2023-10-18T19:52:56.337854","environment_variables":{},"exception":null,"input_path":"__notebook__.ipynb","output_path":"__notebook__.ipynb","parameters":{},"start_time":"2023-10-18T18:26:28.587327","version":"2.4.0"},"colab":{"provenance":[]}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":5}
